    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a simple dish I often like to make when 
        I'm just in the mood for protein with rice. Almost 
        anyone can make it, even those that are inexperienced 
        in the kitchen. </p>
       <p>I would recommend this dish for people that are looking
        to get more protein in their diet, and don't want 
        to make anything too <em>extravagant.</em>
       </p>
       <h2 class="title ing">Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>93/7 ground beef</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>zero-calorie brown sugar</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>sriracha</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat pan to medium high</li>
        <li>Add dry seasonings to ground beef, mix well</li>
        <li>Add oil to pan</li>
        <li>After oil has become warm on pan, place the 
            ground beef into pan, mix around with spatula</li>
        <li>Stir ground beef for about 10 minutes, making 
            none of the meat remains red</li>
        <li>After most of the moisture from the meat has cooked
            off, add the rest of the wet ingredients into pan</li>
        <li>Continue stirring meat with spatula, until all of
            the meat becomes slightly charred and mostly dry</li>
        <li>Pour out the meat onto a plate of rice or into a bowl
            by itself, and <strong><em>enjoy!</em></strong></li>
       </ol>
